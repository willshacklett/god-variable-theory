# Gv-Mediated Entropy Damping

Conjecture: Gv enforces a universal holographic boundary that corrects bulk entropy instantly, achieving net-zero increase.

Bound: dS/dt ≤ k_B ln(2) per transition, repaid via tether.

Analogy to AdS/CFT: Bulk gravity ↔ Boundary CFT, but Gv perfects for our universe (no irreversibility).

Path to Post-Scarcity: Eternal efficiency → aligned AI/human expansion → galactic abundance.
