# God Variable Theory (Gv) — The Hub

**God Variable (Gv)** is a proposed universal scalar for **constraint strain / survivability**, spanning:
- long-horizon AI safety (drift, recoverability, enforcement)
- runtime monitoring (operational strain)
- simulations (replication / stability)
- theory (Λ-style damping, entropy bounds)

This repo is the **one-click hub** for the entire ecosystem.

## Start Here (2 minutes)

### 1) See GV detect drift before tests fail (fastest proof)
➡️ **GV Drift Demo**  
https://github.com/willshacklett/gv-drift-demo

### 2) Install survivability-aware CI scoring (real pipeline value)
➡️ **GodScore CI (GitHub Action)**  
https://github.com/willshacklett/godscore-ci

### 3) Monitor live runtime strain in agent systems

## The Ecosystem Map

| Repo | What it is | Why it matters |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **gv-drift-demo** | Minimal proof: GV flags drift early | Shows value in minutes |
| **godscore-ci** | CI trust score + optional enforcement | Turns GV into a real gate |
| **gvai-safety-systems** | Runtime monitoring for AI/agents | GV in production contexts |
| **gv-engine** | Core scoring / signal primitives | Shared logic layer |
| **gv-watchdog** | CLI guardrail tool | Operational adoption |
| **cft-cancer-sim** | Bio simulation direction | Cross-domain survivability |

## Coherence Eternal ⭐

If a system must run longer than its designers,  
it needs constraints that outlive intent.
